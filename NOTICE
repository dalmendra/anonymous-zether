This project was originally developed in 2020 by JP Morgan Chase Company and it was modified by Kaleido in 2023 and then by Daniel Almendra in 2024.

The main feature implemented in this fork is the possibility to execute DvP Transactions to exchange an ERC-20 for an ERC-1155 token (or vice-versa).

Key modifications:
- New contracts:
	- DvpZSC.sol: this contract was adapted from the one available in https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding/ used in Real Digital project from the Central Bank of Brazil. It enables the DvP transaction using ERC-20 and ERC-1155 tokens.
	- Erc1155Token.sol: this contract implements the ERC-1155 token, which was not available in the original implementation.
	- ZSCERC1155Restricted.sol: this contract was adapted from the one available in https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding/ used in Real Digital project from the Central Bank of Brazil. It corresponds to the original ZSC.sol contract, but now used to represent the private Zether token for the ERC-1155 token.
- Modified contracts:
	- Cashtoken.sol: a mapping for authorizedAccounts was added, new functions to authorize and revoke accounts, new verifyAccount function for account status checks. Minting is now restricted to authorized accounts only.
	- ZSCRestricted.sol: this contract was adapted from the one available in https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding/ used in Real Digital project from the Central Bank of Brazil. It corresponds to the original ZSC.sol representing the private Zether token for the ERC-20 token (CashToken) contract with slight modifications, mainly improvements in the register and transfer functions.
- New deploy script:
	- deploy.js was modified to deploy the new contracts, supporting hardhat and additional logging.

There were also many modifications performed in the anonymous-zether-client application. Please refer to https://github.com/dalmendra/anonymous-zether-client for more information.
